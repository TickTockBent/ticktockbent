# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm TickTockBent

I'm a Web3 infrastructure engineer and DeFi protocol architect with 18+ years of experience in systems engineering, DevOps, and blockchain development. These days, I build smart contract ecosystems, developer tooling, and decentralized infrastructure focused on Polygon and Flux.

- **TimeTickBase** â€“ A Sybil-resistant, time-minted staking protocol with hourly reward cycles and zero-inflation design.
- **ThermAI** â€“ A distributed compute and heat-recapture platform with smart contract-based token sales, staking, and referral logic.
- **ReFlux** â€“ A GitHub-integrated CD tool for automating Flux deployments with wallet-signed triggers and node-level control.
- **Lethe** â€“ A clustered ephemeral state layer with client-side encryption, TTL metadata, and natural data expiration.

_All projects are under active development._
